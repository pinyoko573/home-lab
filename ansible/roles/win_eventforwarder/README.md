# Windows Event Forwarder
It is not possible to automate an exported GPO with dynamic values, so use the Event Forwarder Policy file to create/modify the policies in a new/existing GPO.

If you are setting up on a Active Directory domain environment, use the **Group Policy Management Console** to setup on specific device groups (e.g. Domain Controllers)
